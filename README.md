## Requirements
To run the binary on debian based distros, you only need to install sdl2 (I don't know about other distros)

    sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0

If you wish to build the source, you will also need the SDL2 dev library

    sudo apt install libsdl2-dev


## Usage
 After installing SDL2 you can simply download the executable and run ./spiromorph

 To rebuild the project, clone the repository and type make.

 To see command line options run
    
    ./spiromorph --help
There are lots of options to play around with.

# WANTED
 A SDL2 cross-platform Boilerplate, which allows Windows users to build and run the project.
 Something like this but for SDL2:
 
  https://github.com/rewrking/sfml-vscode-boilerplate

 I suppose I could just use SFML, but I like SDL2.
